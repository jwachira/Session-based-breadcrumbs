Atimes we want to track a the path a user follows when browsing through web pages.Current breadcrumb libraries follow the root node
which means all the child nodes must have relationship to the root node.

In this case we just want to track the path that the user followed to where they are right now.

all you need to is add include the module in helper or something like that 

and in your views do 

<%= bread_crumbs %>
